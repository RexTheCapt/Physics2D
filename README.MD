### Requirements
- Unity (Compile, edit)
- Texteditor (Edit, scripting)

Please check the requirements on each of the programs you are planning to do, i'm not going to list them.

### What is it these tools I use do?
#### Unity

Unity is the program that sets everything together. Basically it's just click and drag for the most of the time, next to non programming at all in unity itself. Unity let me create new scenes that is used as levels, create an object and add a script to it so it can be used in game and lot's of other stuff.

#### Visual Studio

Visual Studio is the program that is used to write all the codes, you can use any text editor you wan't do code with, even notepad (won't work great though). Every scripts I have written is written in this program. *(My favorite IDE)*

#### ReSharper

ReSharper is not required at all, it's an extension to Visual Studio that let's me write better code and clean up some messes I have made. Also scans thru every scripts in the project and tells me if there are any warnings or errors. Can also suggest what to do.

#### Visual Studio Code

![Screenshot on this README while it is WIP](Images/VisualStudioCodeScreenShot&#32;121218.jpg)

I am using VSC for lightweight text editing and as my standard text editor for everything on my systems. Starts faster than VS and is able to do some basic scripting/coding, but VS is still superrior when it comes to C# and unity. VSC can still do stuff that VS can't and the other way arround. Everytime i look at this image i took, it reminds me about inception. I wonder why...
